        <h5>Project Lead</h5>
        <p>
          I have overseen projects operating on national and international level with up to 30 people.
          I have worked in agile and non-agile setups and the majority of projects I have accompanied from the concept phase to implementation.

        <h5>Analytics</h5>
        <p>
          I have built product affinity and churn score prediction models in Python and Spark.
          I have developed and provided guidance in making productive a photovoltaics prediction
          model to enable PV systems for the balancing market. However, most of my work has focused
          on the strategical outlook – integrating analytics into the product workflow, defining
          KPIs and how to generate insights that can be used efficiently by people that don’t
          have a special eye for data and statistics.

        <h5>Product Development</h5>
        <p>
          I have led a variety of projects in product development. Two of them stand out
          to me in retrospect. First, the development of a new e-mobility tariff landscape
          paired with the launch of a successful crowdfunding campaign that brought in
          around 2 million euros. Secondly, the realization of a block-chain-based peer-to-peer
          energy trading platform for an energy community in Vienna.
