  <h2>about me.</h2>
  <p>
    My name is Wolfgang Otter and I am a Data Scientist at Wien Energie, where
    I work on models used in all stages of product development and management,
    and on the general analytics strategy as it relates to the customer lifecycle.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have had the incredible opportunity of being able to fluidly transition
    between product development and analytics and I was able to see the best of both worlds.
    Product ownership can profit immensely from a partnering analytical framework
    that is used in all stages from conceptualization to reporting, otherwise
    risking to become a quest in the dark. On the other hand, analytics without
    a clear purpose can oftentimes (not always, of course) lead to charts and
    dashboards that may shine but aren’t ever put to good use (other than to
    maybe briefly entertain management).
  </p>
  <p>
    In both worlds I mostly occupied the role of project lead/product owner,
    bringing solutions from concept to reality and trying to combine my knowledge in both fields.
